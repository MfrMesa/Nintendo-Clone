# Nintendo-Clone

Project carried out as an evaluation of the Develhope Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

My main role was leading the development of the navbar, using HTML, CSS with responsive design and JavaScript to add interactive functionalities such as dropdowns and animations.

We opted for Trello and Github to stay organized, which made it easy to collaborate and track project progress. We had a delivery time of a month and a half, during which we faced various challenges, from implementing complex functionalities to team coordination and time management. We overcome these challenges with a collaborative and purposeful approach, leveraging our individual skills and working closely to achieve our goals.

The result was a project delivered within the established deadline and we are proud of the work carried out and the collaboration that led to the success of the project.
